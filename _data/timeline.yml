  description: 1. Implemented DeepAffects' Smart Punctuation API and adapted it for time-constrained (more accuracte, 50x faster than DeepPunct) ASR use cases. (Including data collection, dockerization of DL models, client libraries and Kuberentes deployments). <br> 2. Built summarization system for conversational data. (Including data collection, building dialogue act prediction models, clustering, dockerization and kuberentes deployments) <br> 3. Built various analytics and metrics (aspect based key-phrase extraction, call scoring, emotion prediction etc.) for DeepAffects' callspot and calleq. <br> 4. Worked on various parts of ASR pipeline (adapting language models for low-resource domains and domain specific phrases, vad etc.). <br> 5. Adapted DeepSegment for <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W19-5512.pdf"> FinSBD 2019 shared task </a> (First in  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190826120335im_/https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/mk_ewUtljrnSNamH2-8ULGvdaaceBDUmVSohhXIj75JvzgKGtc1eisl5NttkopEQFsHeikURNiMyCdeetqWj1C7sEuoXizbH--nGZPb-OSIBqhiCRQc=w472"> French </a> and Close second in  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190826120335im_/https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/JyvfYeLnHODhSCP901mUkWyD41Mr0d9ABIayegxGg8L3V477XaJYzwEzDAD2LAXiF8OE0VJu93aRVt5XVKgpjqwDvww9naLeDrhXAGNijF2Bz5UnOA=w472"> English </a>  tasks.). <br> 6. Built DeepAffect's Chapter Detection Api (Including image data genetation for chapter type detection, Text Detection and Recognition algorithms and frame level binary search for chapter detection.)

  from: 2018 August
  to: 2019 May
  description: 1. Built data extraction modules for domain specific, large contracts, that can deal with noisy text (result of OCR). <br> 2. Built document categorization system to categorize and rename hundreds of different types of large documents. <br> 3. Built a NLP module that can extract and cross verify information from multiple legal documents. <br> 4.  Built a NER system for domain specific data, with very low amount of training data. <br> 5. Designed and built a novel algorithm, that can extract structured data from different types of tables (multi-line cells, cells separated only by a single space etc.)
