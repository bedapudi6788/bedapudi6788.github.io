- title: Deep Learning engineer, Reckonsys Tech Labs, Bengaluru
  from: 2018 August
  to: 2019 May
  description: 1. Built data extraction modules for various highly domain specific, large contracts that can even deal with nosy text (result of OCR). <br> 2. Built document categorization system that can automatically categorize and rename hundreds of different types of large documents and is extremely fast. <br> 3. Built a NLP module to extract and cross verifies extremely sensitive information from multiple legal documents and reports the anomalies. <br> 4.  Built a named entity recognition system using different machine learning and NLP techniques for highly domain specific data, which can work with very low amount of training data. <br> 5. Designed and built a novel algorithm using manchine-learning, that can extract structured data from hundreds of different types of tables like multi-line cells, cells separated only by a single space etc. 

- title: Junior Research Associate, Abzooba, Pune
  from: 2017 July
  to: 2018 July
  description: 1. Implemented graph db to enhance the accuracy and performance of Abzooba's propitiatory NLU engine. <br> 2. Implemented deep learning (LSTM) based models for a significant change in the performance and F1 scores of our Entity Extraction and Text Classification engines. <br> 3. Explored new state of art methods and implemented them in various projects to decrease the work load of AI trainers and increase accuracy significantly of our predictions with less data. <br> 4. Created a single interface for showcasing our various NLP capabilities, where with a single click the data is trained on different models and results can be viewed. Implemented dynamic loading of trained deep learning models. <br> 5. Worked on the NLP and NLU part of various chatbots, which offer various functionality like clothing suggestions, natural language text to MySQL converters etc.
